## Which factors should be considered when selecting a Region? (Select TWO.)

a) Compliance with data governance and legal requirements -- correct

b) Proximity to your customers --correct

c) Access to 24/7 technical support

d) Ability to assign custom permissions to different users

    - Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
    - Proximity to your customers
    
    Two other factors to consider when selecting a Region are pricing and the services that are available in a Region.

    The other response options are incorrect because:

    - The level of support that you choose is not determined by Region. AWS Support plans are explored later in this course.
    - Assigning custom permissions to different users is a feature that is possible in all AWS Regions.
    The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is available in all AWS Regions.

## Which statement best describes Amazon CloudFront?

a) A service that enables you to run infrastructure in a hybrid cloud approach

b) A serverless compute engine for containers

c) A service that enables you to send and receive messages between software components through a queue

d) A global content delivery service --correct

### Explanation for other options

    Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery service. It uses a network of edge locations to cache content and deliver content to customers all over the world. When content is cached, it is stored locally as a copy. This content might be video files, photos, webpages, and so on.

    The other response options are incorrect because:

    - AWS Outposts is a service that enables you to run infrastructure in a hybrid cloud approach.
    - AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers.
    - Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a service that enables you to send, store, and receive messages between software components through a queue.

### Explanation for other options

    A Region is a separate geographical location with multiple locations that are isolated from each other.

    An Availability Zone is a fully isolated portion of the AWS global infrastructure.

    An origin is the server from which CloudFront gets your files. Examples of CloudFront origins include Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets and web servers. Note: Amazon S3 is explored later in this course.


## Which action can you perform with AWS Outposts?

a) Automate actions for AWS services and applications through scripts.

b) Access wizards and automated workflows to perform tasks in AWS services.

c) Develop AWS applications in supported programming languages.

d) Extend AWS infrastructure and services to your on-premises data center. --correct

### Explanantion for other options
